- What tools did we use to make Traction awesome?

- We built the basic Traction app with Ruby on Rails
- and made it easy for Amy to sign up and log in through Facebook omniauth

- Since it was very important for Amy and her trainer Ander to be able to visualize her progress,
- we chose to create charts using Chart JS 
- and put them in a React component so Amy could click between multiple charts with no page reloads.

- When refactoring the user flow for creating a workout with exercises,
- we decided to use the ruby gem Cocoon for the nested forms.

- We used Rspec for testing
- and achieved 85% test coverage on our Controllers
- and 100% !!!! coverage on our Models!

- Traction is hosted on Heroku
- with a Postgres Database

- Now Derrick will tell you about Traction's future
